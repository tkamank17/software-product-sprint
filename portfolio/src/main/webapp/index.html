      <h1>Tariq's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>This is Tariq Amankwah's portfolio.</p>
    <p> I am a sophomore at Capitol Technology University. I have an interest in computer programs, app development and digital art.</p>
    <p> I have lived in Maryland for all of my life. I found a passion in coding because I enjoy creating new things. The drive to get better on whatever I am working on at the moment what pushes me to <br/> learn more about computer science and software development. </p>
    <p> I usually create projects around a purpose. Some include: </p>
    <li>A weather app in Vue</li>
    <li>An example shopping app</li>
    <li>An example shopping website</li>

    <p>I enjoy photographing nature, and buildings.</p>

    <p>One of my hidden talents would be my stubbornness. I would rather keep trying at something until a have a solid grasp of whatever I am aiming to achieve.</p>
